Welcome to the Cipher Hunt verifier!

## General rules:
  * Anyone can participate!
  * You are allowed to take photos of the ciphers, but please leave them where you find them!
  * If you have any questions or remarks, please e-mail edcipherhunt@gmail.com!
  * It wouldn't be a "hunt" without a variety of prizes for the first ones!
  * You may, of course, collaborate in groups - however do not share the solutions freely to keep the spirit of the hunt.
  * Use of internet is encouraged!

## Prizes:
  * The fastest code-hunters will be awarded interesting prizes!

###### If you think any cipher is not to be found where it should be, write to edcipherhunt@gmail.com
